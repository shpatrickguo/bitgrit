# # Analyzing exam scores
# 
# ## ðŸ“– Background
# Client is an administrator at a large school. The school makes every student take year-end math, reading, and writing exams.
# 
# Let's analyze the score results. The school's principal wants to know if test preparation courses are helpful. She also wants to explore the effect of parental education level on test scores. 

# ## ðŸ’¾ The data
# 
# ### The file has the following fields ([source](http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams)):
# - "gender" - male / female
# - "race/ethnicity" - one of 5 combinations of race/ethnicity
# - "parent_education_level" -  highest education level of either parent
# - "lunch" - whether the student receives free/reduced or standard lunch
# - "test_prep_course" - whether the student took the test preparation course
# - "math" -  exam score in math 
# - "reading" -  exam score in reading 
# - "writing" -  exam score in writing

# ### Observation
# Overall, there is a positive trend between average exam scores and parental education levels, where a higher education level means a high exam score. <br>
# Assuming that `some high school` means that the parent didn't graduate high school: the average scores for `high school` is an outlier to this trend, because it is lower than `some high school`.

# ### Observation
# There is strong positive correlations between students that well on one subject and others. <br>
# Particularly, there is a high `0.95` correlation between scoring well on the reading and writing exam, likely because they are closely related subjects.

# ## Summary
# The average reading scores for students with the test prepartion course: 73.9. <br>
# The average reading scores for students without the test prepartion course: 66.5. <br>
# 
# The positive relationship between average exam score and parental education levels.
# 
# Across all parental education levels, students that completed the test preparation course on average scored higher on the exams compared to students that didn't.
# 
# There is strong positive correlations between students that well on one subject and others.
