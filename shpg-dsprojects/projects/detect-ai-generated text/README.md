# LLM - Detect AI Generated Text

In the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the development of large language models (LLMs). These models have reached a level of sophistication where the text they generate closely resembles that of human authors. This notebook explores machine learning models that can effectively determine whether an essay was authored by a student or generated by a large language model. 

The dataset includes a mixture of essays composed by students and those produced by various LLMs. For each id in the test set, predict a probability that that essay was generated. Results are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.
